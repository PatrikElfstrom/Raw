Raw enables you to upload RAW image files straight from your DSLR to WordPress with thumbnail support and without loosing or damaging the RAW file.

== Description ==

Raw enables you to upload RAW image files straight from your DSLR to WordPress.
Once the RAW image has been uploaded, Raw will create a JPEG copy and WordPress will then generate all thumbnails.

Raw currently suppors DNG, CR2 and NEF out of the box but filters allows you to add support for more file types.

* Upload RAW image files like .DNG, .CR2 and .NEF
* Thumbnail support

Raw requires the PHP module ImageMagic (http://php.net/manual/book.imagick.php) to convert the RAW files to jpeg.

Filters
* upload_mimes_raw_file_types_special
Add special cases where the MIME type is not the same as the file ending.
For example DNG has the TIFF MIME type.

* add_raw_mimes
Add or remove supported RAW file types.
