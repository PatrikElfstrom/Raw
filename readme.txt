Raw enables you to upload RAW image files straight from your DSLR to WordPress with thumbnail support and without loosing or damaging the RAW file.

== Description ==

Raw enables you to upload RAW image files straight from your DSLR to WordPress.
Once the RAW image has been uploaded, Raw will create a JPEG copy and WordPress will then generate all thumbnails.

<h4>Features:</h4>

* Upload RAW images like DNG, CR2 and NEF to WordPress

* Works just like if you uploaded a JPEG.

* Generates a copy for all thumbnail sizes

Raw currently supports DNG, CR2 and NEF out of the box but filters allows you to add support for more RAW image types.

Raw requires the PHP module ImageMagic (http://php.net/manual/book.imagick.php) to convert the RAW files to jpeg.
